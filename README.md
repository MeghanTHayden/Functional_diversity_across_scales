# BioSCape_across_scales

**Goal:** Process airborne hyperspectral imagery to produce maps of functional richness, divergence and evenness.

**Scripts implemented in Python**

**S01:** Module containing functions that pre-process and compute diversity metrics.

**S02:** Full workflow for single image.

**S03:** Workflow for looping through many images; user can choose site, NEON product and year in global parameters and produce FRic values for a range of defined window sizes.
